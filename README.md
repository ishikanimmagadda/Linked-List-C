# Linked-List-C
Implement a generic LinkedList class in C that can store elements of any data type

Description:

Operations: Implement operations such as adding elements, removing elements, accessing elements, and traversing the list.
Generic Implementation: Use void pointers and function pointers to create a generic implementation that can handle different data types.

Specification:

LinkedList Node Structure: Define a struct for the LinkedList node that includes a void pointer for the data and a pointer to the next node
LinkedList Structure: Have a pointer to the head node, the current size, and function pointers for element operations
